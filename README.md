**An open-source, code-first toolkit for building, evaluating, and
deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control.**

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for **developing
and deploying AI agents**. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem,
ADK is **model-agnostic**, **deployment-agnostic**, and is built for
**compatibility with other frameworks**. ADK was designed to make agent
development feel more like software development, to make it easier for
developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures that range
from simple tasks to complex workflows.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions,
  OpenAPI specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse
  capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

- **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
  directly for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
  multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.

- **Tracing and Monitoring**: Built-in agent observability for debugging and optimizing
  workflows.

- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or GKE, or
  scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
